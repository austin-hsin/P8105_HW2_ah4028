## Problem 0

Setup code to load `tidyverse` library

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1 - Data Import, Cleaning, Merging

Importing, cleaning, and merging `pols-month.csv`, `snp.csv`, and
`unemployment.csv`

``` r
# Import and cleaning of 'pols_month_data'
pols_month_data = read.csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")|>
  separate("mon", into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE)|>
  mutate(month = recode(month, 
                        "1" = "Jan",
                        "2" = "Feb",
                        "3" = "Mar",
                        "4" = "Apr",
                        "5" = "May",
                        "6" = "Jun",
                        "7" = "Jul",
                        "8" = "Aug",
                        "9" = "Sep",
                        "10" = "Oct",
                        "11" = "Nov",
                        "12" = "Dec"))|>
  mutate(president = case_when(prez_dem == "1" ~ 'dem',
                               prez_gop == "1" ~ 'gop'))|>
  select(-prez_dem,-prez_gop,-day)

# Import and cleaning 'snp.csv'
snp_data = read.csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")|>
   separate("date", into = c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE)|>
  arrange(month)|>
  mutate(month = recode(month, 
                        "1" = "Jan",
                        "2" = "Feb",
                        "3" = "Mar",
                        "4" = "Apr",
                        "5" = "May",
                        "6" = "Jun",
                        "7" = "Jul",
                        "8" = "Aug",
                        "9" = "Sep",
                        "10" = "Oct",
                        "11" = "Nov",
                        "12" = "Dec"))|>
  mutate(year = ifelse(year > 49, 1900 + year, 2000 + year))|>
  select(year, month, close,-day)|>
  arrange(year)

# Import and cleaning 'unemployment.csv'
unemployment_data = read.csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")|>
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec, values_to = "pct")|>
  rename(month = name, year = Year)

# Merging pols_month_data, snp_data, and unemployment_data
pols_snp_data = full_join(snp_data, pols_month_data, by = c("year", "month"))
hw2_data = full_join(pols_snp_data, unemployment_data, by = c("year", "month"))
```

As a note for whoever is grading this, inline with my github commits, I
had solved problem 1 my own way prior to the release of the solution. I
have kept it as such as my cleaning and merging produced a similar
dataset, just with different naming conventions.

The `pols_month` dataset contains data regarding the number of
politicians based on party affiliation on a monthly basis from 1947 to
2015. The `snp` dataset contains data regarding the monthly closing
values of the S&P 500 stock market index from 1950 to 2015. The
`unemployment` dataset contains data regarding the unemployment rate at
the end of each month from 1948 to 2015.
