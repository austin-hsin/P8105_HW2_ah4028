## Problem 0 - Setup

Setup code to load `tidyverse` and `readxl` library

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

## Problem 1 - Data Import, Cleaning, Merging

Importing, cleaning, and merging `pols-month.csv`, `snp.csv`, and `unemployment.csv`

```{r, pols_month, snp, unemployment}
# Import and cleaning of 'pols_month_data'
pols_month_data = read.csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")|>
  separate("mon", into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE)|>
  mutate(month = recode(month, 
                        "1" = "Jan",
                        "2" = "Feb",
                        "3" = "Mar",
                        "4" = "Apr",
                        "5" = "May",
                        "6" = "Jun",
                        "7" = "Jul",
                        "8" = "Aug",
                        "9" = "Sep",
                        "10" = "Oct",
                        "11" = "Nov",
                        "12" = "Dec"))|>
  mutate(president = case_when(prez_dem == "1" ~ 'dem',
                               prez_gop == "1" ~ 'gop'))|>
  select(-prez_dem,-prez_gop,-day)

# Import and cleaning 'snp.csv'
snp_data = read.csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")|>
   separate("date", into = c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE)|>
  arrange(month)|>
  mutate(month = recode(month, 
                        "1" = "Jan",
                        "2" = "Feb",
                        "3" = "Mar",
                        "4" = "Apr",
                        "5" = "May",
                        "6" = "Jun",
                        "7" = "Jul",
                        "8" = "Aug",
                        "9" = "Sep",
                        "10" = "Oct",
                        "11" = "Nov",
                        "12" = "Dec"))|>
  mutate(year = ifelse(year > 49, 1900 + year, 2000 + year))|>
  select(year, month, close,-day)|>
  arrange(year)

# Import and cleaning 'unemployment.csv'
unemployment_data = read.csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")|>
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec, values_to = "pct")|>
  rename(month = name, year = Year)

# Merging pols_month_data, snp_data, and unemployment_data
pols_snp_data = full_join(snp_data, pols_month_data, by = c("year", "month"))
five_thirty_eight_merged_data = full_join(pols_snp_data, unemployment_data, by = c("year", "month"))
```

As a note for whoever is grading this, inline with my github commits, I had solved problem 1 my own way prior to the release of the solution. I have kept it as such as my cleaning and merging produced a similar dataset with different naming conventions.

The `pols_month` dataset contains data regarding the number of politicians, including governors, senators, and president based on party affiliation on a monthly basis from 1947 to 2015.
The `snp` dataset contains data regarding the monthly closing values of the S&P 500 stock market index from 1950 to 2015.
The `unemployment` dataset contains data regarding the unemployment rate at the end of each month from 1948 to 2015.

The resulting merged dataset, `five_thirty_eight_merged_data has 11 columns and 828 rows and has a complete data year range from 1950 to 2015. Prior to January 1950 and after July 2015, there are a range of missing values from the S&P500 close to the unemployment percentage.

## Problem 2 - Trash Wheel Dataset

Importing and cleaning of 3 different trash wheel datasets

```{r, Mr. Trash Wheel, warning=FALSE}
#Import and cleaning of Mr. Trash Wheel data
mr.trash_wheel_data = read_excel("./202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
sheet = 1, 
range = ("A2:N586"),
col_types = c("numeric","text","numeric","date","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","text"))|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(homes_powered_new = weight_tons*16.67, #Adding new variables
       name = "Mr. Trash Wheel")
```

Here we imported and cleaned the Mr. Trash Wheel data from sheet 1 of the Trash Wheel Collection Data as well as included a new variable `homes_powered_new`, based on the homes powered note, and `name`.

```{r, Professor Trash Wheel}
#Import and cleaning of Professor Trash Wheel data
professor_trash_wheel_data = read_excel("./202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
sheet = 2, 
range = ("A2:M108"),
col_types = c("numeric","text","numeric","date","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","text"))|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(homes_powered_new = weight_tons*16.67, #Adding new variables
       name = "Professor Trash Wheel")
```

Here we similarly imported and cleaned the Professor Trash Wheel data from sheet 2 of the Trash Wheel Collection Data as well as included a new variable `homes_powered_new`, based on the homes powered note, and `name`.

```{r, Gywnnda Trash Wheel}
#Import and cleaning of Gywnnda Trash Wheel data
gywnnda_trash_wheel_data = read_excel("./202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
sheet = 4, 
range = ("A2:L157"),
col_types = c("numeric","text","numeric","date","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric", "text"))|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(homes_powered_new = weight_tons*16.67, #Adding new variables
       name = "Gywnnda Trash Wheel")
```

Here we similarly imported and cleaned the Gywnnda Trash Wheel data from sheet 4 of the Trash Wheel Collection Data as well as included a new variable `homes_powered_new`, based on the homes powered note, and `name`.

# Merged Trash Wheel Dataset

Merging all three trash wheel datasets and describing the resulting dataset

```{r, Trash Wheel Tidy}
#Bind Rows all three trash wheel data sets
trash_wheel_tidy = bind_rows(mr.trash_wheel_data, professor_trash_wheel_data, gywnnda_trash_wheel_data)
```

Resulting `trash_wheel_tidy` dataset has 16 columns and 845 rows that includes variables such as `dumpster`, `date`, `weight` and `volume` of trash, multiple varieties of trash types, `name` identifier for each trash wheel, and the new `powered_homes_new` variable that multiplies weight of trash by (500/30) = 16.67.

Total trash weight collected by Professor Trash Wheel is `r sum(pull(professor_trash_wheel_data, weight_tons))`.

Total number of cigarette butts collected by Gywnnda Trash Wheel in July 2021 is `r sum(pull(filter(gywnnda_trash_wheel_data, month == "July", year == "2021"), cigarette_butts))`.

## Problem 3 - MCI Datasets

Importing and Cleaning of Baseline MCI and Amyloid MCI datasets

```{r, MCI_baseline}
#Importing MCI Baseline Data and cleaning names
MCI_baseline_data = read.csv("./data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv")|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  rename(
    ID = x,
    Baseline_Age = `age_at_the_study_baseline`,
    Sex = `x1_male_0_female`,
    APOE4 = `x1_apoe4_carrier_0_apoe4_non_carrier`,
    MCI_Onset = `age_at_the_onset_of_mci_missing_if_a_subject_remains_mci_free_during_the_follow_up_period`,
        )
```

There were `r nrow(MCI_baseline_data)` participants that were recruited in total.

# Tidying MCI_baseline_data

Tidying MCI_baseline_data and answering questions about the dataset

```{r, MCI_baseline_tidy, warning = FALSE}
#Recoding variables and removing those without age of MCI onset
MCI_baseline_tidy_data = MCI_baseline_data|>
  mutate(Sex = recode(Sex, 
                          "1" = "Male", 
                          "0" = "Female"))|>
  mutate(APOE4= recode(APOE4,
                       `1` = "Carrier",
                       `0` = "Non-Carrier"))|>
  mutate(Baseline_Age = as.numeric(Baseline_Age))|>
  mutate(MCI_Onset = as.integer(MCI_Onset))|>
  mutate(ID = as.numeric(ID))|>
  filter(MCI_Onset != ".")
```

After removing those without a MCI age of onset value, there are `r nrow(MCI_baseline_tidy_data)` subjects with MCI.

Average baseline age is `r round(mean(pull(MCI_baseline_tidy_data, MCI_Onset)), digits = 2)`

The proportion of women who are APOE4 carriers is `r round(nrow(filter(MCI_baseline_tidy_data, Sex == "Female", APOE4 == "Carrier"))/nrow(filter(MCI_baseline_tidy_data, Sex == "Female")),digits=2)`

# MCI Amyloid Dataset

Importing and tidying amyloid dataset

```{r}
MCI_amyloid_data = read_csv("./data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip=1)|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  drop_na()|>
  rename(ID = study_id)|>
  mutate(ID = as.numeric(ID))
```

After removing missing values, the number of observations is `r nrow(MCI_amyloid_data)`.

# Merging Tidy MCI Baseline and MCI Amyloid Datasets

Merging both datasets by `ID`

```{r}
anti_combine_baseline_amyloid = anti_join(MCI_baseline_tidy_data, MCI_amyloid_data, by = "ID")

anti_combine_amyloid_baseline = anti_join(MCI_amyloid_data, MCI_baseline_tidy_data, by = "ID")
```

`r nrow(anti_combine_baseline_amyloid)` participants are within the MCI baseline dataset, and `r nrow(anti_combine_amyloid_baseline)` participants are within the MCI amyloid dataset. 

```{r}
MCI_combine_baseline_amyloid_data = 
  inner_join(MCI_baseline_tidy_data, MCI_amyloid_data, by = "ID")
```

After combining the tidied baseline and amyloid data, we have full data on `r nrow(MCI_combine_baseline_amyloid_data)` participants. 

The average age of those in the full data was `r round(mean(pull(MCI_combine_baseline_amyloid_data, Baseline_Age)), digits=2)` years old.

The average MCI onset age was `r round(mean(pull(MCI_combine_baseline_amyloid_data, MCI_Onset)), digits=2)` years old. 

The number of female subjects is `r nrow(filter(MCI_combine_baseline_amyloid_data, Sex == "Female"))`.

The proportion of APOE4 carriers is `r round(nrow(filter(MCI_combine_baseline_amyloid_data, APOE4 == "Carrier")) / nrow(MCI_combine_baseline_amyloid_data), digits=2)`. 

# Exporting combined MCI dataset

Exporting MCI_combine_baseline_amyloid_data

```{r MCI_combine_baseline_amyloid_data, message=FALSE}
write_csv(MCI_combine_baseline_amyloid_data, "./data_mci/MCI_combine_baseline_amyloid.csv")
```
